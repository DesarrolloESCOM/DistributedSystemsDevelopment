# DSD
Distributed Systems Development

Repository for some homeworks of my school's subject Distributed Systems Development.

## What do you need to run it?

* Gradle (gradle wrapper added).
* JDK 8 (Minor versions are accepted).

## How could I run a homework/practice?

Step 1: Run gradle for solving all the dependencies.

```bash
$ ./gradlew 
```

Step 2: Look into gradle tasks.

```bash
$ ./gradlew tasks
```
Then run the selected tasks to be run, for example:

```bash
$ ./gradlew Ex1_ServerInstance
```
```bash
$ ./gradlew test
```
